# Overview

In this project I experimented with data analysis. It was exciting to practice my R skills and use libraries such as ggplot

The data I analyzed gave information about the life expectancy, population, and gdp per capita of 142 countries between the years 1992 and 2007.

The software I wrote was meant to specifically analize the life expectancies. It answers the question of which country had the highest life expectancy every 10 years and made a visual to show any conection between life expectancy and the other factors.

# Data Analysis Results
I included my questions and answers within my data file

# Development Environment

I used Rstudio to create this project. I included the tidyverse library as well as gapminder, dyplr, and ggplot2. The gapminder library loaded the dataset

# Future Work

* I spent a long time trying to figure out how to get the country name associated with the max life expectancy as a variable but even after reaching out for help I couldn't get it figured out. This is something I would want to learn about in the future
